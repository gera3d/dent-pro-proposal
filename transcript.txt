Okay, so you were going to explain a workflow to me. Go ahead and do that. Well, yeah, so just starting in to a main software hub that's used for progressive catastrophe drives that I'll be using. Yeah. It's called Mitchell Connect and what happens is what happens is there's like a hundred jobs that get put into the tasks and then you get a nightly email saying this is how many jobs are for tomorrow. So you may have a few hundred just in the batch but then all of a sudden you get a nightly email with a list that says these are the ones that are coming tomorrow and with this it has all of this customers all the customers information already on this this database. So what happens is obviously we have our list and when the people come in we'll you know we check them in. So actually I'm just explaining from a systems level like how many systems we have to use. So we have this initial system okay and so all their jobs everything like it's literally you're accessing it right from your phone it's super easy to use very intuitive and so for the scope what we're talking about with this sheet is you know there's a tool that I want to use called OrcaScan where you can just scan the VIN number then using OrcaScan and with OrcaScan you can give it automations and triggers with you know I think it says Google Docs and you know a few others and where it'll convert over you know all the good information you need like it you can make it fill in the RO, the location, the VIN number, the year make and model and who the estimator is and then a few other things but basically like eight things in total and so far that's in alignment with this sheet so that's eight things the person doesn't have to do off the bat. So now they have their sheet and what happens is when they're done filling out this sheet they then I need them to have the ability to you know save this sheet to um I haven't gotten this far fully but basically they have this sheet and now it's like a saved PDF or whatever to either that database that's organized or easily being able to send off to the next person which is going to be the um the writer and who then will reattach that scope sheet as a PDF or whatever to the actual Mitchell database again so they'll they'll save that PDF that was done by the scoper and save it back into the Mitchell database because they're writing their estimate in Mitchell attached to this customer file they're working with. So um that's just the scoping portion I haven't gotten into well what happens then when you know obviously that's the fulfillment that's one job okay yes that's that's that's the fulfillment with Progressive. We did your estimate for your customer Progressive there's your the scope sheet we did here's all the photos here's everything we did it's uploaded to their file now when it comes to dent experts as a company what if we capture that business and now they're our customer well not only is you know it's similar like everything is still saved in the same area but now they're our customer and now we need to get all that information into go high level what I'm currently using as the CRM as a customer that is the vehicle is is uh is dropped off it's ready to go um and you know we're putting that and hopefully maybe sending triggers to maybe now like telling high level hey I want this information now all in this opportunity file right to where maybe maybe for the admin's sake well maybe she doesn't have to refill out all that information like the VIN number and maybe it could be like just clicking on this and now well boom there's your opportunity file there's their claim number there's their VIN number the location who the scoper was um you know maybe now who the sales rep is yeah um now I'm just now I'm just bobbing and weaving yeah no Judah what you just explained is like I think perfect in the sense that you just outlined exactly what you guys are doing and the busy work that's pretty much created every single time you guys deal with a customer and based on this explanation I think there's a very clear kind of like v1 to uh accomplishing this task and I think that v1 is taking exactly that form that you sent over to me and making it really easy for the people that work for you to fill that out on an iPad and I think if we create a simple dashboard that has authentication maybe log in with your google account and push one button that's in the dashboard which is like create a new one of these things uh and then when you push that this form just shows up and then once they fill out all the information and push save then that document saves into their dashboard so it shows like okay uh you know here's the car here's all the details associated with it and then I can just push one button and download that pdf I think that's version one that that project that I just explained that's like the mvp if the mvp works really well and everybody's happy with that process then we can begin tying in some apis and apis is like a way for these pieces of software to talk to each other so uh let's say this person is logged into the dashboard instead of having to go to michelin and download like the queue of jobs that are waiting for you you'll just be able to log into your own software and say like okay like onboard these into the system and then like all of the the accounts like the potential leads will load into your dashboard and then you can create one of these pdfs for every single one of those so that's like the next phase as far as implementing pdfs and then we can kind of create the next connection to high level where after everything is like all connected in your system you could just be like export this to high level into a lead and then it will take all of that information so that you don't have to type it every single time and just pipe it over into your high level instance right and yeah and that's yeah but this is like a lot of triggers but yeah and i think the way that we do this is we just build it out in stages where the mvp doesn't even have any apis the mvp is just they fill out a form and have a dashboard that's a record of that information yeah and they're really the only api that i see needed for this form and i just there's no other way around it is by you by using this uh this orca scan app which see that is from what i was learning just talking to chat gbt it's like so everyone has anyone that's using that any user which there'll just be scopers that are doing this scan yeah so every scoper has their own login to orca scan and literally all they're doing is scanning the pin and the only purpose of that is just so that they don't have to manually fill in like eight boxes on the form yeah and what what it does is it they log into orca scan they scan the vin and then orca scan sends all that information over and automatically generates the correct pdf electronic document they need and then they can start filling out the form because it's already now generated what you're making model it is the ro number and then they have to manually input like the insurance name the claim number um and then they can do everything else um you know just by check boxes and drop downs but that's kind of the workflow yeah judah that makes perfect sense to me i'm going to stop the recording here because i think uh
